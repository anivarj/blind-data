Blind your .tif files and create a handy key for unscrambling later

### Note
* Test-data images come from https://imagej.net/
* I have only tested this with python 3.7.6
* You must have pandas installed to run this script
* I am a newb so if you have any tips to make my repos/code better, let me know!
