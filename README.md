# blind-data
Blind your .tif files and create a handy key for unscrambling later

### Note
* Test-data images come from https://imagej.net/
* I have only tested this with python 3.7.6
* I am a newb so if you have any tips to make my repos/code better, let me know! 

## Getting started
Install git and conda and then run:
```
git clone git://github.com/anivarj/blind-data
cd blind-data
conda env create
conda activate blind-data
```
This will create an environment called 'blind-data' from the environment.yml file that has the correct packages needed.
<br><br>You can then either run the .py file directly using python, or you can run the jupyter notebook file.
<br>To run the jupyter notebook, run:
```
jupyter notebook Blinding.ipynb
```
